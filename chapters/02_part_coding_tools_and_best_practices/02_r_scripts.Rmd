# R scripts

Up to this point, I've only showed you how to submit your R code to R in the console. \@ref(fig:using-console)

```{r using-console, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Submitting R code in the console."}
# knitr::include_graphics("img/02_part_coding_tools_and_best_practices/02_r_scripts/using_console.png")
```

Submitting code directly to the console in this way works well for quick little tasks and snippets of code. But, writing R programs this way has some drawbacks that are probably already obvious to you. Namely, your code isn't saved anywhere. And, because it isn't saved anywhere, you can't modify it, use it again later, or share it with others.

Technically, the statements above are not entirely true. When you submit code to the console, it is copied to RStudio's History pane and from there you can save, modify, and share with others. But, this method is much less convenient, and provides you with far fewer whistles and bells than the other methods we'll discuss in this book. \@ref(fig:history)

```{r history, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Console commands copied to the History pane."}
# knitr::include_graphics("img/02_part_coding_tools_and_best_practices/02_r_scripts/history.png")
```

Those of you who have worked with other statistical programs before may be familiar with the idea of writing, modifying, saving, and sharing code scripts. SAS calls these code scripts "SAS programs", Stata calls them "DO files", and SPSS calls them "SPSS syntax files". If you haven't created code scripts before, don't worry. There really isn't much to it. 

In R, the most basic type of code script is simply called an R script. An R script is just a plane text document that contains R code and comments. R scipt files end with the file extension `.R`. For example, I might write a script to import some data
