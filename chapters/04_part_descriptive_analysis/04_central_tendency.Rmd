# Measures of central tendency

In previous sections you've seen methods for describing individual categorical variables. Now we’ll switch over to numerically describing numerical variables.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04_part_descriptive_analysis/flowchart_num_numerical.png")
```

In epidemiology, we often want to describe the "typical" person in a population with respect to some characteristic that is recorded as a numerical variable -- like height or weight. The most basic, and probably most commonly used, way to do so is with a measure of central tendency.    

In this chapter we’ll discuss three measures of central tendency:

* **The mean**   
* **The median**    
* **The mode**    

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04_part_descriptive_analysis/central_tendency_01.png")
```

Now, this is not a statistics course. But, I'm going to briefly discuss these measures, and some of their characteristics, below to make sure that we’re all on the same page when we discuss the interpretation of our results.

**The mean**

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04_part_descriptive_analysis/central_tendency_02.png")
```

When we talk about the typical, or “average”, value of some variable measured on a continuous scale, we are usually talking about the mean value of that variable. To be even more specific, we are usually talking about the arithmetic mean value. This value has some favorable characteristics that make it a good description of central tendency.

👍 For starters it’s simple. Most people are familiar with the mean, and at the very least, have some intuitive sense of what it means (no pun intended).    

👍 In addition, there can be only one mean value for any set of values.    

However, there are a couple of potentially problematic characteristics of the mean as well: 

👎 It’s susceptible to extreme values in your data. In other words, a couple of people with very atypical values for the characteristic you are interested in can drastically alter the value of the mean, and your estimate for the typical person in your population of interest along with it.

👎 Additionally, it’s very possible to calculate a mean value that is not actually observed anywhere in your data. 

<p class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** The sample mean is often referred to as $\bar{x}$, which pronounced "x bar."</p>

**The median**

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04_part_descriptive_analysis/central_tendency_03.png")
```

The median is probably the second most commonly used measure of central tendency. Like the mean, it’s computationally simple and relatively straightforward to understand. 👍 There can be one, and only one, median. 👍 And, its value may also be unobserved in the data.👎

However, unlike the mean, it’s relatively resistant to extreme values. 👍 In fact, when the median is used as the measure of central tendency, it’s often because the person conducting the analysis suspects that extreme values in the data are likely to distort the mean.

**The mode**

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04_part_descriptive_analysis/central_tendency_04.png")
```

And finally, we have the mode, or the value that is most often observed in the data. It doesn’t get much simpler than that. 👍 But, unlike the mean and the median, there can be more than one mode for a given set of values. In fact, there can even be no mode if all the values are observed the exact same number of times.👎

However, if there is a mode, by definition it’s observed in the data.👍

Now that we are all on the same page with respect to the fundamentals of central tendency, let’s take a look at how to calculate these measures using R.

## Calculate the mean

Calculating the mean is really straightforward. We can just use base R's built-in `mean()` function.

```{r message=FALSE}
# Load the tibble package for the tribble function
library(tibble)
# Load the dplyr package. We will need several of dpylr's functions in the 
# code below.
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Simulate some data
height_and_weight_20 <- tribble(
  ~id,   ~sex,     ~ht_in, ~wt_lbs,
  "001", "Male",   71,     190,
  "002", "Male",   69,     177,
  "003", "Female", 64,     130,
  "004", "Female", 65,     153,
  "005", NA,       73,     173,
  "006", "Male",   69,     182,
  "007", "Female", 68,     186,
  "008", NA,       73,     185,
  "009", "Female", 71,     157,
  "010", "Male",   66,     155,
  "011", "Male",   71,     213,
  "012", "Female", 69,     151,
  "013", "Female", 66,     147,
  "014", "Female", 68,     196,
  "015", "Male",   75,     212,
  "016", "Female", 69,     19000,
  "017", "Female", 66,     194,
  "018", "Female", 65,     176,
  "019", "Female", 65,     176,
  "020", "Female", 65,     102
)
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

* We loaded the `tibble` package so that we could use its `tribble()` function.    

* We used the `tribble()` function to simulate some data -- heights and weights for 20 hypothetical students.
  
  - The `tribble()` function creates something called a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/). A tibble is the `tidyverse` version of a data frame. In fact, it _is_ a data frame, but with some additional functionality. You can use the link to read more about it if you'd like.   
  
  - We used the `tribble()` function instead of the `data.frame()` function to create our data frame above because we can use the `tribble()` function to create our data frames in rows (like you see above) instead of columns with the `c()` function.    
  
  - Using the `tribble()` function to create a data frame isn't any better or worse than using the `data.frame()` function. I just wanted you to be aware that it exists and is sometimes useful.

```{r}
mean(height_and_weight_20$ht_in)
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

* We used base R's `mean()` function to calculate the mean of the column "ht_in" from the data frame "height_and_weight_20".

  - Note: if you just type `mean(ht_in)` you will get an error. That's because R will look for an object called "ht_in" in the global environment. 
  
  - However, we didn't create an object called "ht_in". We created an object (in this case a data frame) called "height_and_weight_20". That object has a column in it called "ht_in".

  - So, we must specifically tell R to look for the "ht_in" column in the data frame "height_and_weight_20". Using base R, we can do that in one of two ways: `height_and_weight_20$ht_in` or `height_and_weight_20[["ht_in"]]`.
  
## Calculate the median

Similar to above, we can use base R's `median()` function to calculate the median.

```{r}
median(height_and_weight_20$ht_in)
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

* We used base R's `median()` function to calculate the modian of the column "ht_in" from the data frame "height_and_weight_20".

## Calculate the mode

Base R does not have a built-in `mode()` function. Well, it actually does have a `mode()` function, but for some reason that function does not return the mode value(s) of a set of numbers. Instead, the `mode()` function gets or sets the type or storage mode of an object. For example:

```{r}
mode(height_and_weight_20$ht_in)
```

This is clearly not what we are looking for. So, how do we find the mode value(s)? Well, we are going to have to build our own mode function. Later in the book, I'll return to this function and walk you through how I built it one step at a time. For now, just copy and paste the code into R on your computer. Keep in mind, as is almost always the case with R, my way of writing this function is only one of multiple possible ways.

```{r}
mode_val <- function(x) {
  
  # Count the number of occurrences for each value of x
  value_counts <- table(x)
  
  # Get the maximum number of times any value is observed
  max_count <- max(value_counts)
  
  # Create and index vector that identifies the positions that correspond to
  # count values that are the same as the maximum count value: TRUE if so
  # and false otherwise
  index <- value_counts == max_count
  
  # Use the index vector to get all values that are observed the same number 
  # of times as the maximum number of times that any value is observed
  unique_values <- names(value_counts)
  result <- unique_values[index]
  
  # If result is the same length as value counts that means that every value
  # occured the same number of times. If every value occurred the same number
  # of times, then there is no mode
  no_mode <- length(value_counts) == length(result)
  
  # If there is no mode then change the value of result to NA
  if (no_mode) {
    result <- NA
  }
  
  # Return result
  result
}
```

```{r}
mode_val(height_and_weight_20$ht_in)
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

* We created our own function, `mode_val()`, that takes a vector (or data frame column) as a value to its "x" argument and returns the mode value(s) of that vector.

* We can also see that the function works as expected when there is more than one mode value. In this case, "65" and "69" each occur 4 times in the column "ht_in". 

## Compare mean, median, and mode

<!-- This isn't HOW to get the mean. This a comparison of the mean and the median - the WHY -->

Now that you know how to calculate the mean, median, and mode, let's compare these three measures of central tendency. This is a good opportunity to demonstrate some of the different characteristics of each that we spoke about earlier.

```{r}
height_and_weight_20 %>% 
  summarise(
    min_weight    = min(wt_lbs),
    mean_weight   = mean(wt_lbs),
    median_weight = median(wt_lbs),
    mode_weight   = mode_val(wt_lbs) %>% as.double(),
    max_weight    = max(wt_lbs)
  )
```

👆 **Here's what we did above:**

* We used the `mean()` function, `median()` function, and our `mode_val()` function inside of dpylr's `summarise()` function to find the mean, median, and mode values of the column "wt_lbs" in the "height_and_weight_20" data frame.

* We also used the `as.double()` function to convert the value returned by `mode_val()` -- "176" -- from a character string to a numeric double. This isn't strictly necessary, but I think it looks better.

* Finally, we used base R's `min()` and `max()` functions to view the lowest and highest weights in our sample. 

## Data checking

Do you see any red flags 🚩as you scan the results? Do you really think a mean weight of 1,113 pounds sounds reasonable? This should definitely be a red flag for you. Now move your gaze three columns to the right and notice that the maximum value of weight is 19,000 lbs – an impossible value for a study in human populations. In this case the real weight was supposed to be 190 pounds, but the person entering the data accidently got a little trigger-happy with the zero key. 

This is an example of what I meant when I said "We can use descriptive analysis to uncover errors in our data" in the [Introduction to descriptive analysis] chapter. Often times, for various reasons, some observations for a given variable take on values that don’t make sense. Starting by calculating some basic descriptive statistics for each variable is one approach you can use to try to figure out if you have values in your data that don’t make sense.

In this case we can just go back and fix our data, but what if we didn’t know this value was an error? What if it were a value that was technically possible, but very unlikely? Well, we can’t just go changing values in our data. It’s unethical, and in some cases illegal. Below, we discuss the how the properties of the median and mode can come in handy in situations such as this.

## Properties of mean, median, and mode 

Despite the fact that this impossibly extreme value is in our data, the median and mode estimates are reasonable estimates of the typical person’s weight in this sample. This is what I meant when I said that the median and mode were more “resistant to extreme values” than the mean. 

You may also notice that no person in our sample had an actual weight of 1,112.75 (the mean) or even 176.5 (the median). This is what I meant above when I said that the mean and median values are “not necessarily observed in the data.”

In this case, the mode value (176) is also a more reasonable estimate of the average person's weight than the mean. And unlike the mean and the median, participants 18 and 19 actually weigh 176 pounds. I'm __not__ saying that the mode is always the best measure of central tendency to use. However, I __am__ saying that you can often learn useful information from your data by calculating and comparing these relatively simple descriptive statistics on each of your numeric variables.
