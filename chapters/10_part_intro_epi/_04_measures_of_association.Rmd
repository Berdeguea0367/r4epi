# Notes

* Start with the [PPT](https://uthtmc-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/michael_b_cannell_uth_tmc_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B2D09C0AF-062A-4FB1-8B74-DEA53387410B%7D&file=measures_of_assocaition.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true) for this module. It looks like there is some useful stuff. 

* Also, add in stuff from the Modern Epi chapter on Measures of Effect and Measures of Association (linked above). 

* Remember that there doesn't need to be a one-to-one correlation between Epi III modules and R4Epi Chapters. We can assign multiple chapters for a given module.
