# Useful resources

* [Modern Epidemiology, Chapter 4, Measures of Occurrence](https://wolterskluwer.vitalsource.com/reader/books/9781975166298/epubcfi/6/22)

* [Epi III OneDrive](https://uthtmc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/michael_b_cannell_uth_tmc_edu//_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?login_hint=Michael%2EB%2ECannell%40uth%2Etmc%2Eedu&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fmichael%5Fb%5Fcannell%5Futh%5Ftmc%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2F03%20Teaching%2F01%20Courses%20%2D%20Current%2FEpi%20III)

# Notes

* Start with the [PPT](https://uthtmc-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/michael_b_cannell_uth_tmc_edu/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B42BFC14E-B01C-45CA-AC65-E107EBB7DDFB%7D&file=measures_of_occurrence.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true) for the Measures of Occurence module. It looks like there is some useful stuff. 

* Also, add in stuff from the Modern Epi chapter on Measures of Effect and Measures of Occurrence (linked above). 

* Remember that there doesn't need to be a one-to-one correlation between Epi III modules and R4Epi Chapters. We can assign multiple chapters for a given module.

# Populations

<!--
Adding some helper functions to help with population plots.
Set everything to echo=FALSE. The goal here isn't to teach learners how to make
population plots. It is simply to use them as a visual aid for learning 
about populations and samples.
