[In the previous chapter][Introduction to git and GitHub], we discussed _why_ we should consider learning to use git and GitHub as part of our workflow when our projects include data and/or coding. In this chapter, we will begin to talk about _how_ to use git and GitHub. We will also introduce a third tool, GitKraken, that makes it easier for us to use git and GitHub.

## Install git

Before we can use git, we will need to install it on our computer. The following chapter of Pro Git provides instructions for installing git on Linux, Windows, and MacOS operating systems: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git. 

If you are using a Mac, it‚Äôs likely that you already have git ‚Äî most Macs ship with git installed. To check, open your Terminal app. The Terminal app is located in the Utilities folder, which is located in the Applications folder. In the terminal app, type ‚Äúgit version‚Äù. If you see a version number, then it is already installed. If not, then please follow the installation instructions given in the link to Pro Git above.

```{r terminal, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Checking git version in the MacOS terminal."}

```

## Install GitKraken

Git is software for our computer. It‚Äôs an application just like RStuido, Microsoft Word, or your favorite calendar app. However, unlike those apps, git does not have a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) (GUI - pronounced "gooey"). In other words, there is no git app that we can open and start clicking around in. Instead, by default, we interact with git by typing commands into the computer‚Äôs terminal (like we saw in \@ref(fig:terminal)). The commands we type to use git kind of look like their own programming language. In our experience, interacting with git in the terminal is awkward, inefficient, and unnecessary for most new git users. And learning to use git in this way is a barrier to getting started in the first place. üò©

Thankfully, other third-party vendors have made excellent GUI's for git that we can download and use for free. Our current favorite is called **GitKraken**. To use GitKraken, you will first need to navigate to the GitKraken website (https://www.gitkraken.com/).

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_part_collaboration/gitkraken_01_home.png")
```

Next, you will need to click on the ‚ÄúTry Free‚Äù button. Then, download and install the GitKraken Client to your computer.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_part_collaboration/gitkraken_02_client.png")
```

Before you use the GitKraken client, you will need to sign up for an account. It may say that you need to sign up for a free trial. Go ahead and do it. The free trial is just for the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù version. At the end of the free trial, you will automatically be downgraded to the ‚ÄúFree‚Äù version, which is‚Ä¶ free. And, the free version will do everything you need to do to follow along with this book. 

## Sign up for a GitHub account

We have already alluded to the fact that git and GitHub are not the same thing. You can use git locally on your computer without ever using GitHub. Conversely, you can browse GitHub, and even do some limited contributing to code, without ever installing git on your computer (e.g., see [Contributing to R4Epi](#contributing-to-r4epi))). However, git and GitHub work best when used together. You don‚Äôt need to download anything to start using GitHub, but you will need to sign up for a free GitHub account. To do so, just navigate to https://github.com/ 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_part_collaboration/github_01_home.png")
```

Then, click the ‚Äúsign up‚Äù button and follow the instructions. Once you have installed Git and GitKraken, and you‚Äôve created your GitHub account, you will have all the tools you need to follow along with all of the examples in this book. Speaking of examples, let‚Äôs go ahead and take a look at a couple now.

## Example 1: Contribute to R4Epi 

If you haven't already done so, please read the [contributing to R4Epi portion of the book's welcome page](#contributing-to-r4epi)). This will give you a gentle introduction to using GitHub, for a very practical purpose, without even needing to use git or GitKraken. 

## Example 2: Create a repository for a research project

In this example, we will learn how to create our very own git and GitHub repositories from scratch. We can immediately begin using the lessons from this example for our research projects -- even if we aren't collaborating with others on them. Remember, [there are at least four overarching reasons why you should consider learning to use git and GitHub as part of your workflow for your projects](#introduction-to-git-and-GitHub), and collaboration is only one of them. Not to mention the fact that it is often useful to think of our future selves as other collaborators, which we have mentioned and/or alluded to many times in this book. 

There are many possible ways we could set up our project to take advantage of all that git and GitHub have to offer. We're going to show you one possible sequence of steps in this example, but you may decide that you prefer a different sequence as you get more experience, and that's totally fine!

### Step 1: 

## Example 2: Contribute to a research project

When our research assistants begin helping us with data management and analysis projects, we often have them start by going to the project‚Äôs GitHub repository to read the existing documentation and [clone][Cloning a repository] all the existing code to their computer. This example is going to walk us through that process step-by-step. For demonstration purposes, we created a fake GitHub account for a fictitious research assistant named "Arthur Epi." If you want to follow along, you can use your GitHub account in place of Arthur‚Äôs.

[As previously mentioned][Collaboration], a research project that we both work on is the Detection of Elder abuse Through Emergency Care Technicians (DETECT) project. In this example, Arthur is going to help us with cleaning and analyzing some of the pilot data collected as part of the DETECT project. We could email Arthur all of the project files, but that might be _many_ files, some of them may be very large, and we run the risk of forgetting to send some of them by accident. Further, every time we add or update a file, we will have to email Arthur (and anyone else working on the project) the new file and an explanation. This is inefficient and error-prone! Conversely, we could set up a shared folder on a cloud-based file storage service like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. Doing so would circumvent the issues caused by emailing files that we just mentioned (i.e., many files, large files, forgetting files, and manually sending updates). However, Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive aren‚Äôt designed to take advantage of all that git has to offer (e.g., project documentation, versioning and version history, viewing differences between code versions, issue tracking, creating static websites for research dissemination, and more). Because we created a **repository** on GitHub for the DETECT project, all of the files and documentation Arthur needs to get started are easily accessible to him. All, we have to do is send him the repository‚Äôs web address, which is https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect_pilot_test_5w. 

**Repositories** are the fundamental organizational units of your GitHub account. Other cloud storage services like Dropbox are organized into file folders at every level. Meaning, you have your main Dropbox folder, which has other folders nested inside of it -- many of which may have their own nested folders. Your GitHub account also stores all your files in file folders; however, the level one folders ‚Äî those that aren‚Äôt nested inside of another folder ‚Äî are called repositories (represented by the book icon in the image below). Typically, each repository is an entire, self-contained project. Like a file folder, each repository can contain other folders, code files, media files, data sets, and any other type of file needed to reproduce your research project.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="GitHub repositories compared to Dropbox."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_part_collaboration/repositories_01.png")
```

As you can see in the screenshot below ([you can also navigate to the website yourself](https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect_pilot_test_5w)), GitHub creates a basic little website for each repository. The top middle portion of the page (outlined in red) displays all of the files and folders in the repository. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_part_collaboration/detect_github_01_files.png")
```

To the right of files and folders is the About section of the page. This section (outlined in red below) can contain a description of your repository, tags, and other information that will ignore for now.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_part_collaboration/detect_github_02_about.png")
```

Below the files and folders section of the page is where the **README** file is displayed. We will discuss the [README file] in greater detail below. For now, just know that this is a great place to provide visitors to your repository with some basic information about your research project, and document how to use the files in your repository. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_part_collaboration/detect_github_03_readme.png")
```

Returning to our example, Arthur has navigated to https://github.com/brad-cannell/detect_pilot_test_5w. He has read over the README file, which gave him greater understanding of what the DETECT project is all about and how to files in the repository are structured. At this point, Arthur is ready to start making edits and additions to the DETECT code files. 

While it is technically possible for Arthur edit code files directly on GitHub (see [Contributing to R4Epi]), this is typically only a good idea for extremely minor edits (e.g., a typo in the documentation). Typically, we will want to make a copy of all the code files on our computer so that we can experiment with the edits we are making. Let's walk Aurther through that process now.
