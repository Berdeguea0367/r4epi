```

We introduced regression modeling generally in the [introduction to regression analysis chapter][Introduction to Regression Analysis]. In this chapter, we will discuss fitting linear regression models, a type of generalized linear model, to our data using R. **In general, the linear model is a good place to start with the regressand we want to model is continuous**. We will begin by loading some useful R packages and simulating some data to fit our model to. We add comments to the code below to help you get a sense for how the values in the simulated data are generated. But please skip over the code if it feels distracting or confusing, as it is not the primary object of our interest right now.

```{r linear-regression-load-packages}
# Load the packages we will need below
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(broom) # Makes glm() results easier to read and work with
library(ggplot2)
library(meantables)
library(freqtables)
```

```{r linear-regression-sim-data}
# Set the seed for the random number generator so that we can reproduce our results
set.seed(123)

# Set n to equal the number of people we want to simulate. We will use n
# repeatedly in the code below.
n <- 20

# Simulate a data frame with n rows
# The variables in the data frame are generic continuous, categorical, and 
# count values. They aren't necessarily intended to represent any real-life 
# health-related state or event
df <- tibble(
  # Create a continuous regressor containing values selected at random from
  # a normal distribution
  x_cont  = rnorm(n, 10, 1),
  # Create a categorical regressor containing values selected at random from
  # a binomial distribution with a 0.3 probability of success (i.e., 
  # selecting a 1)
  x_cat   = rbinom(n, 1, .3),
  # Create a continuous regressand that has a value that is equal to the value
  # of x_cont plus or minus some random variation. The direction of the
  # variation is dependent on the value of x_cat.
  y_cont  = if_else(
    x_cat == 0, 
    x_cont + rnorm(n, 1, 0.1), 
    x_cont - rnorm(n, 1, 0.1)
  ),
  # Create a categorical regressand that has a value selected at random from
  # a binomial distribution. The probability of a successful draw from the 
  # binomial distribution is dependent on the value of x_cat.
  y_cat   = if_else(
    x_cat == 0,
    rbinom(n, 1, .1),
    rbinom(n, 1, .5)
  ),
  # Create a regressand that contains count data selected at random from
  # a categorical distribution. The probability of a selecting each value from 
  # the distribution is dependent on the value of x_cat.
  y_count = if_else(
    x_cat == 0,
    sample(1:5, n, TRUE, c(.1, .2, .3, .2, .2)),
    sample(1:5, n, TRUE, c(.3, .3, .2, .1, .1))
  )
)

# Print the value stored in df to the screen
df
```

## Continuous regressand and continuous regressor

Now that we have some simulated data, we will fit and interpret a few different linear models. We will start by fitting a linear model with a single continuous regressor. 

```{r}
glm(
  y_cont ~ x_cont,                      # Formula
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"), # Family/distribution/Link function
  data   = df                           # Data
)
```

This model isn't the most interesting model to interpret because we are just modeling numbers without any context. However, because we are modeling numbers without any context, we can strip out any unnecessary complexity or biases from our interpretations. Therefore, in a sense, these will be the "purist", or at least the most general, interpretations of the regression coefficients produced by this type of model. We hope that learning these general interpretations will help us to understand the models, and to more easily interpret more complex models in the future.

<!-- Interpret model results other than coefficients. For example, degrees of freedom, null deviance, residual deviance, and AIC -->

### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The mean value of `y_cont` when `x_cont` is equal to zero. 

2. x_cont: The average change in `y_cont` for each one-unit increase in `x_cont`. 

## Continuous regressand and categorical regressor

Next, we will fit a linear model with a single categorical regressor. Notice that the formula syntax, the distribution, and the link function are the same for the single categorical predictor as they were for the single continuous predictor. We just swap our `x_cont` for `x_cat` in the formula. 

```{r}
glm(
  y_cont ~ x_cat,                       # Formula
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"), # Family/distribution/Link function
  data   = df                           # Data
)
```

### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The mean value of `y_cont` when `x_cat` is equal to zero. 

2. x_cat: The change in the mean value of `y_cont` when `x_cat` changes from zero to one. 

Now that we have reviewed the general interpretations, let's practice using linear regression to explore the relationship between two variables that feel more like a scenario that we may plausibly be interested in.

## Waist circumference and deep abdominal adipose tissue

> ‚ÄúDespres et al. point out that the topography of adipose tissue (AT) is associated with metabolic complications considered as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. It is important, they state, to measure the amount of of intraabdominal AT as part of the evaluation of the cardiovascular-disease risk of an individual. Computed tomography (CT), the only available technique that precisely and reliably measures the amount of deep abdominal AT, however, is costly and requires irradiation of the subject. In addition, the technique is not available to many physicians. Depres and his colleagues conducted a study to develop equations to predict the amount of deep abdominal AT from simple anthropometric measurements. Their subjects were men between the ages of 18 and 42 years who were free from metabolic disease that would require treatment. Among the measurements taken on each subject were deep abdominal AT obtained by CT and waist circumference. A question of interest is how well one can predict and estimate deep abdominal AT from knowledge of waist circumference.‚Äù @Daniel2013-qq

We will start by simulating some data to roughly match the scenario above.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
daat_waist <- tibble(
  waist    = rnorm(n, 39, 2),
  waist_c  = waist - 39,
  beta1    = rnorm(n, 3.45, 0.2),
  daat_bar = rnorm(n, 101, 8),
  daat     = daat_bar + (beta1 * waist_c)
)
daat_waist
```

Now, let's explore the relationship between waist circumference and deep abdominal adipose tissue in our simulated data.

### Continuous regressor (waist circumference)

What is the average waist circumference?

```{r}
mean(daat_waist$waist)
```

What is the average value of deep abdominal adipose tissue?

```{r}
mean(daat_waist$daat)
```

What does the relationship between deep abdominal adipose tissue and waist circumference look like as a scatter plot?

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(daat_waist, aes(x = waist, y = daat)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Deep abdominal adipose tissue") +
  xlab("Waist circumference") +
  theme_bw()
```

What is the relationship between deep abdominal adipose tissue (regressand) and waist circumference (regressor)?

```{r}
glm(
  daat ~ waist,
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
  data   = daat_waist
)
```

#### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The mean value of deep abdominal adipose tissue when waist circumference is 0 is -9.580. 

2. waist: The average change in deep abdominal adipose tissue for each one inch increase in waist circumference is 2.86. 

And we can add this information to our plot.

```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(daat_waist, aes(x = waist, y = daat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = -9.580, slope = 2.862, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  ylab("Deep abdominal adipose tissue") +
  xlab("Waist circumference") +
  theme_bw()
```

### Categorical regressor (large waist)

```{r}
daat_waist <- daat_waist %>% 
  mutate(
    large_waist   = if_else(waist < mean(waist), 0, 1),
    large_waist_f = factor(large_waist, 0:1, c("No", "Yes"))
  )
daat_waist
```

```{r}
daat_by_large_f <- daat_waist %>% 
  group_by(large_waist_f) %>% 
  mean_table(daat)

daat_by_large_f
```

```{r}
ggplot(daat_waist, aes(x = large_waist_f, y = daat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = c(0.75, 1.75), y = mean, xend = c(1.25, 2.25), yend = mean), 
    linewidth = 1.5, color = "red", data = daat_by_large_f
  )
```

What is the relationship between deep abdominal adipose tissue (regressand) and tall (regressor)?

```{r}
glm(
  daat ~ large_waist_f,
  family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
  data   = daat_waist
)
```

#### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The mean value of deep abdominal adipose tissue among people who are not tall is equal to 98.228. 

2. large_waist_fYes: The average change in deep abdominal adipose tissue for people with a large waste circumference compared to people with a small waste circumference is 8.854.

```{r}
98.228 + 8.854
```



## Logistic regression

Now, let‚Äôs talk about logistic regression.

```{r intro-regression-regression-models-03, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/11_part_regression/01_intro_regression/regression_models_03.png")
```

<!-- Below here from lab warm-up -->

### Elder mistreatment

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
em_dementia <- tibble(
  age = sample(65:100, n, TRUE),
  dementia = case_when(
    age < 70 ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.99, .01)),
    age < 75 ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.97, .03)),
    age < 80 ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.91, .09)),
    age < 85 ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.84, .16)),
    age < 90 ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.78, .22)),
    TRUE ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.67, .33))
  ),
  dementia_f = factor(dementia, 0:1, c("No", "Yes")),
  em = case_when(
    dementia_f == "No"  ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.9, .1)),
    dementia_f == "Yes" ~ sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.5, .5))
  ),
  em_f = factor(em, 0:1, c("No", "Yes"))
)
em_dementia
```

#### Categorical regressor (dementia)

```{r}
em_dementia %>% 
  freq_table(dementia_f, em_f) %>% 
  select(row_var:n_row, percent_row)
```

```{r}
glm(
  em_f  ~ dementia_f,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  data   = em_dementia
)
```

##### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The natural log of the odds of `elder mistreatment` among people who do not have dementia is -2.734. (Generally not of great interest or directly interpreted)

2. dementia_fYes: The average change in the natural log of the odds of `elder mistreatment` among people with dementia compared to people without dementia.

```{r}
tibble(
  intercpet   = exp(-2.1734),
  dementia_or = exp(2.282)
)
```

3. dementia_fYes: People with dementia have 9.8 times the odds of `elder mistreatment` among compared to people without dementia.

```{r}
em_dementia_ct <- matrix(
  c(a = 7, b = 11, c = 5, d = 77),
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE
)

em_dementia_ct <- addmargins(em_dementia_ct)

dimnames(em_dementia_ct) <- list(
  Dementia = c("Yes", "No", "col_sum"), # Row names
  EM       = c("Yes", "No", "row_sum")  # Then column names
)

em_dementia_ct
```

```{r}
incidence_prop <- em_dementia_ct[, "Yes"] / em_dementia_ct[, "row_sum"]
em_dementia_ct <- cbind(em_dementia_ct, incidence_prop)
em_dementia_ct
```

```{r}
incidence_odds <- em_dementia_ct[, "incidence_prop"] / (1 - em_dementia_ct[, "incidence_prop"])
em_dementia_ct <- cbind(em_dementia_ct, incidence_odds)
em_dementia_ct
```

```{r}
ior <- em_dementia_ct["Yes", "incidence_odds"] / em_dementia_ct["No", "incidence_odds"]
ior
```

```{r}
# Alternative coding
em_dementia %>% 
  freq_table(dementia_f, em_f) %>% 
  select(row_var:n_row, percent_row) %>% 
  filter(col_cat == "Yes") %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_row = percent_row / 100,
    odds = prop_row / (1 - prop_row)
  ) %>% 
  summarise(or = odds[row_cat == "Yes"] / odds[row_cat == "No"])
```

#### Continuous regressor (age)

```{r}
ggplot(em_dementia, aes(x = age, y = em_f)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
em_dementia %>%
  group_by(em_f) %>% 
  mean_table(age)
```

```{r}
glm(
  em_f  ~ age,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  data   = em_dementia
)
```

##### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The natural log of the odds of `elder mistreatment` among people who do not have dementia is -3.80. (Generally not of great interest or directly interpreted)

2. age: The average change in the natural log of the odds of `elder mistreatment` for each one-year increase in age is 0.02.

```{r}
glm(
  em_f  ~ age,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  data   = em_dementia
) %>% 
  broom::tidy(exp = TRUE, ci = TRUE)
```

```{r}
em_age_70 <- -3.180 + (0.02127 * 70)
em_age_70
```

```{r}
em_age_71 <- -3.180 + (0.02127 * 71)
em_age_71
```

```{r}
em_age_71 - em_age_70
```

```{r}
exp(0.02127)
```

```{r}
em_dementia %>% 
  filter(age %in% c(70, 71))
```

<!-- Above here from lab warm-up -->

Assumptions
- The outcome, Y, follows a Bernoulli distribution
- The mean of Y is given by the logistic function (see previous slide)
- Observations are independent

Make sure that the linear relationship modeled is at least a useful approximation of the real world. In order to do this, one must be very familiar with one‚Äôs data.

Unlikely that this would ever be a perfect fit; however, most would expect a perfectly fit regression (where it even possible) to be to complicated to be of practical value.

## Poisson regression

Now, let‚Äôs talk about Poisson regression. We still have our intercept and slope, but now we have this thing called the offset. This will explicitly model period of time. 

```{r intro-regression-regression-models-04, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/11_part_regression/01_intro_regression/regression_models_04.png")
```

### Number of drinks and personal problems

Consider a study with the following questions:

1. ‚ÄúThe last time you drank, how many drinks did you drink?‚Äù

2. ‚ÄúSometimes people have personal problems that might result in problems with work, family or friends. Have you had personal problems like that?‚Äù

<!-- Below here from lab warm-up -->

```{r}
set.seed(100)
n <- 100
drinks <- tibble(
  problems = sample(0:1, n, TRUE, c(.7, .3)),
  age = rnorm(n, 50, 10),
  drinks = case_when(
    problems == 0 & age > 50 ~ sample(0:5, n, TRUE, c(.8, .05, .05, .05, .025, .025)),
    problems == 0 & age <= 50 ~ sample(0:5, n, TRUE, c(.7, .1, .1, .05, .025, .025)),
    problems == 1 & age > 50 ~ sample(0:5, n, TRUE, c(.2, .3, .2, .2, .05, .05)),
    problems == 1 & age <= 50 ~ sample(0:5, n, TRUE, c(.3, .1, .1, .2, .2, .1)),
  )
)

drinks
```

### Count regressand and continuous regressor

```{r}
mean(drinks$drinks)
```

```{r}
ggplot(drinks, aes(x = age, y = drinks)) +
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
ggplot(drinks, aes(x = age, y = drinks)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
glm(
  drinks  ~ age,
  family  = poisson(link = "log"),
  data    = drinks
)
```

#### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The natural log of the mean number of `drinks` when `age` is equal to zero is 0.113739. 

2. age: The average change in the natural log of the mean number of `drinks` for each one-year increase in `age` is -0.001131. 

```{r}
glm(
  drinks  ~ age,
  family  = poisson(link = "log"),
  data    = drinks
) %>% 
  broom::tidy(exp = TRUE)
```

3. Participants reported 0.9 times the number of drinks at their last drinking episode for each one-year increase in age.

```{r}
drinks_age_50 <- 0.113739 + (-0.001131 * 50)
drinks_age_50
```

```{r}
drinks_age_51 <- 0.113739 + (-0.001131 * 51)
drinks_age_51
```

```{r}
drinks_age_51 - drinks_age_50
```

```{r}
exp(-0.001131)
```

This is an incidence rate ratio. Remember that a rate is just the number of events per some specified period of time. In this case, the specified period of time is the same for all participants, so the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù time cancels out, and we get a rate ratio.

What's our null value for a rate ratio?

### Count regressand categorical regressor

```{r}
mean(drinks$drinks)
```

```{r}
ggplot(drinks, aes(x = factor(problems), y = drinks)) +
  geom_point() 
```

```{r}
ggplot(drinks, aes(x = factor(problems), y = drinks)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.25, alpha = .5) 
```

```{r}
glm(
  drinks  ~ problems,
  family  = poisson(link = "log"),
  data    = drinks
)
```

#### Interpretation

1. Intercept: The natural log of the mean number of `drinks` when `problems` is equal to zero is -0.3848. 

2. problems: The average change in the natural log of the mean of `drinks` when `problems` changes from zero to one.

```{r}
glm(
  drinks  ~ problems,
  family  = poisson(link = "log"),
  data    = drinks
) %>% 
  broom::tidy(exp = TRUE)
```

3. Participants reporting that they had personal problems, drank 2.99 times more drinks at their last drinking episode compared to those who reported no personal problems.

This is an incidence rate ratio. Remember that a rate is just the number of events per some specified period of time. In this case, the specified period of time is the same for all participants, so the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù time cancels out, and we get a rate ratio.

<!-- Above here from lab warm-up -->

Assumptions
- Natural logarithm of the expected number of events per unit time changes linearly with the predictors
- At each level of the predictors, the number of events per unit time has variance equal to the mean
- Observations are independent
