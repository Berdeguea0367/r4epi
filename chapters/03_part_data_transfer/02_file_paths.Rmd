# File paths

<!-- 
This chapter gives an overview of file paths.

Maybe start with importing data and then come back to this?

In this part of the book, we will need to work with **file paths**. File paths are nothing more than directions that tell R where to find, or place, data on our computer. In our experience, however, some students are a little bit confused about file paths at first. So, in this chapter we will briefly introduce what file paths are and how to find the path to a specific file on our computer.

Let‚Äôs say that we want you to go to the store and buy a loaf of bread.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/store.png")
```

When we say ‚Äúgo to the store‚Äù, this is really a shorthand way of telling you a much more detailed set of directions. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/directions.png")
```

Not only do you need to do _all_ of the steps in the directions above, but you also need to use the _exact sequence_ above in order to arrive at the desired destination.

File paths aren't so different. If we want R to "go get" the file called my_study_data.csv, we have to give it directions to where that file is located. But, the file's location is not a geographic location that involves making left and right turns. Rather, it is a location in your computer's file system that involves moving deeper into folders that are nested inside one another.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/locations.png")
```

For example, let's say that we have a folder on our desktop called "NTRHD" for "North Texas Regional Health Department.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/ntrhd.png")
```

And, my_study_data.csv is inside the NTRHD folder.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/my_study_data.png")
```

We can give R directions to that data using the following path:

`/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/NTRHD/my_study_data.csv` (On Mac)

OR

`C:/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/NTRHD/my_study_data.csv` (On Windows)

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** Mac and Linux use forward slashes in file paths (`/`) by default. Windows uses backslashes (`\`) in file paths by default. However, no matter which operating system we are using, we should still use forward slashes in the file paths we pass to import and export functions in RStudio. **In other words, use forward slashes even if you are using Windows.**</p>

These directions may be read in a more human-like way by replacing the slashes with "and then". For example, `/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/NTRHD/my_study_data.csv` can be read as "starting at the computer's home directory, go into files that are accessible to the username `bradcannell`, and then go into the folder called `Desktop`, and then go into the folder called `NTRHD`, and then get the file called `my_study_data.csv`."

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** You will need to change `bradcannell` to your username, unless your username also happens to be `bradcannell`.</p>

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** Notice that we typed `.csv` at the end immediately after the name of our file `my_study_data`. The `.csv` we typed is called a **file extension**. File extensions tell the computer the file's type and what programs can use it. In general, we MUST use the full file name and extension when importing and exporting data in R.</p>

**Self Quiz:**

Let's say that we move `my_study_data.csv` to a different folder on our desktop called `research`. What file path would we need to give R to tell it how to find the data?


`/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/research/my_study_data.csv` (On Mac)

OR

`C:/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/research/my_study_data.csv` (On Windows)

Now let's say that we created a new folder inside of the `research` folder on our desktop called `my studies`. Now what file path would we need to give R to tell it how to find the data?

`/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/research/my studies/my_study_data.csv` (On Mac)

OR

`C:/Users/bradcannell/Desktop/research/my studies/my_study_data.csv` (On Windows)

## Finding file paths

Now that we know how file paths are constructed, we can always type them manually. However, typing file paths manually is tedious and error prone. Luckily, both Windows and MacOS have shortcuts that allow us to easily copy and paste file paths into R.

On a Mac, we right-click on the file we want the path for and a drop-down menu will appear. Then, click the `Get Info` menu option.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/get_info.png")
```

Now, we just copy the file path in the `Where` section of the get info window and paste it into our R code.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/where.png")
```

Alternatively, as shown below, we can right click on the file we want the path for to open the same drop-down menu shown above. But, if we hold down the `alt/option` key the `Copy` menu option changes to `Copy ... as Pathname`. We can then left-click that option to copy the path and paste it into our R code.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/file_path_gif.gif")
```

A similar method exists in Windows as well. First, we _hold down the shift key_ and right click on the file we want the path for. Then, we click `Copy as path` in the drop-down menu that appears and paste the file path into our R code.

## Relative file paths

All of the file paths we've seen so far in this chapter are **absolute file paths** (as opposed to **relative file paths**). In this case, _absolute_ just means that the file path begins with the home directory. Remember, that the home directory in the examples above was `/Users/bradcannell`. When we are collaborating with other people, or sometimes even when we use more than one computer to work on our projects by ourselves, this can problematic. Pause here for a moment and think about why that might be...

Using absolute file paths can be problematic because the home directory can be different on every computer we use, and is almost certainly different on one of our collaborator's computers. Let's take a look at an example. In the screenshot below, we are importing an Excel spreadsheet called `form_20.xlsx` into R as an R data frame named `df`. Don't worry about the import code itself. We will learn more about [importing Microsoft Excel spreadsheets][Importing Microsoft Excel spreadsheets] soon. For now, just look at the file path we are passing to the `read_excel()` function. By doing so, we are telling R where to go find the Excel file that we want to import. In this case, are we giving R an absolute or relative file path?

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/relative_file_paths_01_absolute_brad.gif")
```

We are giving R an _absolute_ file path. We know this because it starts with the home directory -- `/Users/bradcannell`. Does our code work? 

Yes! Our code does work. We can tell because there are no errors on the screen and the `df` object we created looks as we would expect it to when we print it to the screen. Great!!

Now, let's say that our research assistant -- Arthur Epi -- is going to help us analyze this data as well. So, we share this code file with him. What do you think will happen when he runs the code on his computer?

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/03_part_data_transfer/02_file_paths/relative_file_paths_02_absolute_arthur.gif")
```

When Arthur tries to import this file on his computer using our code, he gets an error. The error tells him that the path `/Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/02 Teaching/R4Epi Textbook/test_relative_links/data/form_20.xlsx` doesn't exist. And on Arthur's computer it doesn't! The file `form_20.xlsx` exists, but not at the location `/Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/02 Teaching/R4Epi Textbook/test_relative_links/data/`. This is because Arthur's home directory is `/Users/arthurepi` not `/Users/bradcannell`. The directions are totally different!

So, could Arthur just change the absolute link to work on his computer? Sure! He could do that, but then it wouldn't work on Brad's computer. So, could there just be two code chunks in the file -- one for Brad's computer and one for Arthur's computer? Sure! We could do that, but then one code chunk or the other will always throw an error on someone's computer. That will mean that we won't ever be able to just run our R code in its entirety. We'll have to run it chunk-by-chunk to make sure we skip the chunk that throws an error. And, this problem would just be multiplied if we are working with 5, 10, or 15 other collaborators instead of just 1. So, is there a better solution? 

Now that we know what file paths are and how to find them, let's use them to import and export data to and from R.
