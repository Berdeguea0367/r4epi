# Letâ€™s get programming

Let's do it!

Let's look at a couple more examples to make this idea more concrete. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("John", "Sally", "Brad"),
  sick = c(1, 0, 0)
)
```

The code chunk above creats a data frame. As we discussed in the the what is R chapter, "data frame" is just R's term for a data set -- data organized into rows and columns.
