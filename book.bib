  abstract     = "Spaces in File Names Generally, in the computer science and
                  IT worlds, it is typically frowned on when files, web
                  addresses - or really any kind of programming at all - are
                  named with spaces inside of the title. The reasoning behind
                  this is very simple. Empty space signifies the ``end'' of a
                  character string. Spaces inside of a URL or a linked file
                  basically generate a faulty syntax that the server reads as
                  the end of a character string. The server sees ``the end''
                  and stops processing. When the full string is not processed,
                  it can not be properly represented on your computer screen.",
