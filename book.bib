  abstract = "This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You'll
              learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful
              structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book,
              you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a
              chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you'll
              learn how to clean data and draw plots---and many other things
              besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen,
              and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these
              things with R. You'll learn how to use the grammar of graphics,
              literate programming, and reproducible research to save time.
              You'll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate
              discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.",

  abstract     = "Spaces in File Names Generally, in the computer science and
                  IT worlds, it is typically frowned on when files, web
                  addresses - or really any kind of programming at all - are
                  named with spaces inside of the title. The reasoning behind
                  this is very simple. Empty space signifies the ``end'' of a
                  character string. Spaces inside of a URL or a linked file
                  basically generate a faulty syntax that the server reads as
                  the end of a character string. The server sees ``the end''
                  and stops processing. When the full string is not processed,
                  it can not be properly represented on your computer screen.",
