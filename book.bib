  abstract = "This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You'll
              learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful
              structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book,
              you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a
              chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you'll
              learn how to clean data and draw plots---and many other things
              besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen,
              and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these
              things with R. You'll learn how to use the grammar of graphics,
              literate programming, and reproducible research to save time.
              You'll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate
              discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.",

               acclaimed and best-selling guide offers a rich blend of
               practical advice and real-life examples. The authors draw on
               fifty years of experience, providing detailed step-by-step
               guidance designed to help students and researchers write and
               present scientific manuscripts more successfully through
               knowledge, practice, and an efficient approach. Retaining the
               user-friendly style of the previous editions, this fourth
               edition has been broadened to include detailed information
               relevant to today's digital world. It covers all aspects of the
               writing process, from first drafts, literature retrieval, and
               authorship to final drafts and electronic publication. A new
               section provides extensive coverage of ethical issues, from
               plagiarism and dual publication to honesty in reporting
               statistics. Both the text and 30 hands-on exercises include
               abundant examples applicable to a variety of writing contexts,
               making this a powerful tool for researchers and students across

  abstract     = "Spaces in File Names Generally, in the computer science and
                  IT worlds, it is typically frowned on when files, web
                  addresses - or really any kind of programming at all - are
                  named with spaces inside of the title. The reasoning behind
                  this is very simple. Empty space signifies the ``end'' of a
                  character string. Spaces inside of a URL or a linked file
                  basically generate a faulty syntax that the server reads as
                  the end of a character string. The server sees ``the end''
                  and stops processing. When the full string is not processed,
                  it can not be properly represented on your computer screen.",
