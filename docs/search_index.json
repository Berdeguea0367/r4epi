This electronic book was originally created to accompany my Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research course at the University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health. However, I hope it will be useful to anyone who is interested in R and epidemiology. Acknowledgements This book is currently a work in progress (and probably always will be); however, there are already many people who have played an important role (some unknowingly) in helping develop it thus far. First, I‚Äôd like to offer my gratitude to all past, current, and future members of the R Core Team for maintaining this amazing, free software. I‚Äôd also like to express my gratitude to everyone at RStudio. You are also developing and giving away some amazing software. In particular, I‚Äôd like to acknowledge Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Both have had a huge impact on how I use, and teach, R. I‚Äôd also like to thank my students for all the feedback they‚Äôve given me while taking my course. In particular, I want to thank Jared Wiegand and Yiqun Wang for their many edits and suggestions. This electronic textbook was created and published using R, RStudio, the bookdown package, GitHub, and Netlify. "],["introduction.html", "Introduction Goals Text conventions used in this book Other reading", " Introduction Goals We‚Äôre going to start the introduction by writing down some basic goals that underlie the construction and content of this book. We‚Äôre writing this for you, the reader, but also to hold ourselves accountable as we write. So, feel free to read if you are interested or skip ahead if you aren‚Äôt. The goals of this book are: To teach you how to use R and RStudio as tools for applied epidemiology. Our goal is not to teach you to be a computer scientist or an advanced R programmer. Therefore, some readers who are experienced programmers may catch some technical inaccuracies regarding what we consider to be the fine points of what R is doing ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù To make this writing as accessible and practically useful as possible without stripping out all of the complexity that makes doing epidemiology in real life a challenge. In other words, We‚Äôre going to try to give you all the tools you need to do epidemiology in ‚Äúreal world‚Äù conditions (as opposed to ideal conditions) without providing a whole bunch of extraneous (often theoretical) stuff that detracts from doing. Having said that, we will strive to add links to the other (often theoretical) stuff for readers who are interested. To teach you to accomplish common tasks, rather than teach you to use functions or families of functions. In many R courses and texts, there is a focus on learning all the things a function, or set of related functions, can do. It‚Äôs then up to you, the reader, to sift through all of these capabilities and decided which, if any, of the things that can be done will accomplish the tasks that you are actually trying to accomplish. Instead, we will strive to start with the end in mind. What is the task we are actually trying to accomplish? What are some functions/methods we could use to accomplish that task? What are the strengths and limitations of each? To start each concept by showing you the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product. To learn concepts with data instead of (or alongside) mathematical formulas and text descriptions, where possible. We find that it is easier for many people to understand new concepts by seeing them in action. Text conventions used in this book Bold text is used to highlight important terms, file names, and file extensions. Highlighted inline code is used to emphasize small sections of R code and program elements such as variable or function names. Other reading If you are interested in R4Epi, you may also be interested in: Hands-on Programming with R by Garrett Grolemund. This book is designed to provide a friendly introduction to the R language. R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This book is designed to teach readers how to do data science with R. Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive inot R and the Tidyverse. This book is designed to be a gentle introduction to the practice of analyzing data and answering questions using data the way data scientists, statisticians, data journalists, and other researchers would. Reproducable Research with R and RStudio by Christopher Gandrud. This book gives you tools for data gathering, analysis, and presentation of results so that you can create dynamic and highly reproducible research. Advanced R by Hadley Wickham. This book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language.

Therefore, we welcome and appreciate all constructive contributions to R4Epi! Typos The easiest way for you to contribute is to help us clean up the little typos and grammatical errors that inevitably sneak into the text. If you spot a typo, you can offer a correction directly in the easiest way to offer a correction is directly in GitHub. You will first need to create a free GitHub account: sign-up at github.com. Later in the book, there is an entire chapter on [using Git and Github]. Here, we‚Äôre just going to walk you through how to fix a typo without much explanation of how GitHub works. Let‚Äôs say you spot a typoo while reading along. Next, click the edit button in the toolbar as shown in the screenshot below. Figure 0.1: The edit button. Close up, it looks like this: Figure 0.2: The edit button (zoomed in). The first time you click the icon, you will be taken to the R4Epi repository on GitHub and asked to Fork the it. That basically just means make a copy of all the textbook files on your GitHub account. So, you will first fix the typos you found in your copy of the files that make up the book instead of directly editing the actual book files. This is a safeguard to prevent people from accidentally making changes that shouldn‚Äôt be made. üóíSide Note: Forking the R4Epi repository does not cost any money or add any files to your computer. After you fork the repository, you will see a text editor on your screen. The text editor will display the contents of the file ‚Äì called an R markdown file ‚Äì used to make the chapter you were looking at when you clicked the edit button. In our example it was the ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù page. We will learn more about R markdown files contain in the chapter on R markdown, but for now just know that R Markdown files contain a mix of R code and plain text like the text you are reading right now. You may not understand the code yet, but you will probably be able to skim through the document and find the typo you want to fix. Clicking there will take you to the R4Epi repository on GitHub. For now, you can think of the respository as a Dropbox or Google Docs folder that anyone can view. an editable This will take you to an editable version of the the source R Markdown file that generated the page you‚Äôre on.
