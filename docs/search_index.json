[["measures-of-association.html", "44 Measures of Association 44.1 Exposures and outcomes", " 44 Measures of Association This chapter is under heavy development and may still undergo significant changes. As a reminder, we said that epidemiology is usually defined as something like, ‚Äúthe study of the occurrence and distribution of health-related states or events in specified populations, including the study of the determinants influencing such states, and the application of this knowledge to control the health problems‚Äù1 in the Introduction to Epidemiology chapter. In the chapter about measures of occurrence, we focused on some of the ways we can measure the occurrence of those health-related states or events. In this chatper, we will start discussing ways we can measure the distribution of those health-related states or events. üóíSide Note: Writing (and reading) ‚Äúhealth-related states or events‚Äù over and over starts to get cumbersome after a while. Therefore, we will often just use ‚Äúconditions‚Äù or ‚Äúevents‚Äù in the text below instead. Further, the methods we discuss below can just as easily be applied to better understanding characteristics of populations that would not typically be described as a ‚Äúcondition‚Äù or ‚Äúevent‚Äù. For example, sex assigned at birth or ethnicity. Remember, that our measurement and analysis goals can be broken down into description, prediction, and/or causally explanation of health-related states or events in populations of people. We said that when we describe health-related states or events, we are not necessarily looking for associations in the data between two or more variables. Sometimes, we are simply looking at the distribution of values in a single variable/measure. For example: How many ventilators are available in Texas? What is the average age of people living in Florida? How much time elapses, on average, between exposure to a pathogen and occurrence of disease symptoms? However, there are also times when we want to compare the distribution of value in one variable within levels of another variable. Most people would consider these comparisons to be equivalent to measuring associations. For example: Are there more ventilators available in Texas or New York? Are people older, on average, in Florida or Pennsylvania? Is symptom onset quicker, on average, for Cholera or E. coli? One could also make the case that this starts to overlap with prediction. It sort of just depends on how the information is being used. But, when our goal is prediction, it is safe to say that associations will be of great interest to us. So, what are associations? ‚Äú[An association is a] statistical dependence between two or more events, characteristics, or other variables. An association is present if the probability of occurrence of an event or characteristic, or the quantity of a variable, varies with the occurrence of one or more other events, the presence of one or more other characteristics, or the quantity of one or more other variables.‚Äù1 There‚Äôs a lot in that definition, so let‚Äôs break it down a little bit more. First of all, we can reasonably substitute the word ‚Äúoutcome‚Äù in for the part of the definition that reads ‚Äúan event or characteristic, or the quantity of a variable.‚Äù Second, we can reasonably substitute the word ‚Äúexposures‚Äù for the part of the definition that reads ‚Äúevents, the presence of one or more other characteristics, or the quantity of one or more other variables.‚Äù Doing so would change the second sentence of the defintion above to: An association is present if the probability of occurrence of an outcome varies with the occurrence of one or more other exposures. This is more concise, but we still need to unpack some terms in that definition. Specifically, what is a probability, what is an exposure, and what is an outcome? 44.1 Exposures and outcomes In epidemiology, the terms exposure and outcome are used all of the time. Both terms can refer to pathogens, environmental conditions, behaviors, traits, social conditions, diseases or health conditions, and/or treatments or interventions. Table 44.1 below contains some examples. Table 44.1: Examples of exposures and outcomes. Term Examples Pathogens Tapeworm, Malaria, Ringworm, Streptococcus, and HPV Environmental condtions Smoking, Physical Activity, Sleep, and Sexual behaviors Behaviors Genotype and Sex assigned at birth Social conditions Discrimination, Neighborhood characteristics, and Culture Diseases or condtions Diabetes, Heart disease, and Cancers Treatments or interventions Medications, Smoking cessation programs, and Laws and policies References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
