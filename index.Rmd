Welcome to R for Epidemiology! 

This electronic book was originally created to accompany my Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research course at the [University of Texas Health Science Center School of Public Health](https://sph.uth.edu/). However, I hope it will be useful to anyone who is interested in R and epidemiology.

<p class = "large-bold">Acknowledgements</p>

This book is currently a work in progress (and probably always will be); however, there are already many people who have played an important role (some unknowingly) in helping develop it thus far. First, I’d like to offer my gratitude to all past, current, and future members of the R Core Team for maintaining this _amazing_, _free_ software. I’d also like to express my gratitude to everyone at RStudio. You are also developing and _giving away_ some amazing software. In particular, I’d like to acknowledge **Garrett Grolemund** and **Hadley Wickham**. Both have had a huge impact on how I use, and teach, R. I’d also like to thank my students for all the feedback they’ve given me while taking my course. In particular, I want to thank **Jared Wiegand** and **Yiqun Wang** for their many edits and suggestions. 

This electronic textbook was created and published using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) package, [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Dr. Cannell received his PhD in Epidemiology, and Graduate Certificate in Gerontology, in 2013 from the University of Florida. He received his MPH with a concentration in Epidemiology from the University of Louisville in 2009, and his BA in Political Science and Marketing from the University of North Texas in 2005. During his doctoral studies, he was a Graduate Research Assistant for the Florida Office on Disability and Health, an affiliated scholar with the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, and a student-inducted member of the Delta Omega Honorary Society in Public Health. In 2016, Dr. Cannell received a Graduate Certificate in Predictive Analytics from the University of Maryland University College, and a Certificate in Big Data and Social Analytics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

He previously held professional staff positions in the Louisville Metro Health Department and the Northern Kentucky Independent District Health Department. He spent three years as a project epidemiologist for the Florida Office on Disability and Health at the University of Florida. He also served as an Environmental Science Officer in the United States Army Reserves from 2009 to 2013.

Dr. Cannell’s research is broadly focused on healthy aging and health-related quality of life. Specifically, he has published research focusing on preservation of physical and cognitive function, living and aging with disability, and understanding and preventing elder mistreatment. Additionally, he has a strong background and training in epidemiologic methods and predictive analytics. He has been principal or co-investigator on multiple trials and observational studies in community and healthcare settings. He is currently the principal investigator on multiple data-driven federally funded projects that utilize technological solutions to public health issues in novel ways.

# Introduction {-}

**Goals**

I'm going to start the introduction by writing down some basic goals that underlie the construction and content of this book. I'm writing this for you, the reader, but also to hold myself accountable as I write. So, feel free to read if you are interested or skip ahead if you aren't.

The goals of this book are:   

1. To teach you how to use R and RStudio as tools for applied epidemiology. It is not to turn you into a computer scientist or a hard-core R programmer. Therefore, some readers who are experienced programmers may catch some technical inaccuracies on what I consider to be the fine points of what R is doing "under the hood."    

2. To make this writing as accessible and practically useful as possible without stripping out all of the complexity that makes doing epidemiology in real life a challenge. In other words, I'm going to try to give you all the tools you need to _do_ epidemiology in "real world" (as opposed to ideal) conditions without providing a whole bunch of extraneous (often theoretical) stuff that detracts from _doing_. Having said that, I will strive to add links to the other (often theoretical) stuff for readers who are interested.

3. To teach you to accomplish common tasks, rather than teach you to use functions. In many R courses and texts, I've noticed a focus on learning all the things a function, or set of related functions, can do. It's then up to you, the reader, to sift through all of these capabilities and decided which, if any, of the things that _can_ be done will accomplish the tasks that you are _actually trying_ to accomplish. Instead, I will strive to start with the end in mind. What is the task we are actually trying to accomplish? What are some functions/methods I could use to accomplish that task? What are the strengths and limitations of each?

4. To start each concept with the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. I find that it is easier for me to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product.

5. To learn concepts with data instead of (or alongside) mathematical formulas and text descriptions, where possible. I find that it is easier for me to understand new concepts by seeing them in action.

**Text conventions used in this book**

* **Bold** text is used to highlight important **terms**, file names, and file extensions.

* `Highlighted inline code` is used to emphasize small sections of R code and program elements such as variable or function names.
