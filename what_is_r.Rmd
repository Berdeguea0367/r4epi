# What is R?

At this point in the book, you should have installed R and RStudio on your computer, but you may be thinking to yourself, “I don’t even know what R is.” Well, in this chapter you’ll find out. I’ll start with an overview of the R language, and then briefly touch on its capabilities and uses. You’ll also see a complete R program and some complete reports generated by R programs. In this book you’ll learn how to create similar programs and reports, and by the end of the book you’ll be able to write your own R programs and present your results in the form of an issue brief written for general audiences who may or may not have public health expertise.

But, before we discuss R let’s discuss something even more basic – data. Here’s a question for you: What is data?

Data is information about objects (e.g., people, places, schools) and observable phenomenon (e.g., weather, temperatures, and disease symptoms) that is recorded and stored somehow as a collection of symbols, numbers, and letters.

Below is a table, which is a common way of organizing data. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/What is R/Slide3.png")
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/What is R/Slide4.png")
```

Each box in the table is called a cell.
